      In mid-20s New York, Newt Scamander, the British young activist wizard, arrives in town, 
      holding a mysterious leather suitcase which shelters a wide array of diverse and magical 
      creatures that exist among us. Amid an already fragile equilibrium of secrecy, and the 
      increasing disasters ascribed to the dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, Newt's precious 
      suitcase will be lost--and to make matters worse--several creatures will manage to 
      escape. Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves' attention 
      who will target Newt, in the background of an invisible, devastating, and utterly 
      unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc on 5th Avenue. In the end, is there a hidden
       agenda behind Graves' intentions; moreover, what will happen to the remaining fantastic 
      beasts still loose in the streets?

      More than two decades have passed since Sarah Connor prevented Judgment Day, changed the 
      future, and re-wrote the fate of the human race. Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is living a 
      simple life in Mexico City with her brother (Diego Boneta) and father when a highly 
      advanced and deadly new Terminator - a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) - travels back through time 
      to hunt and kill her. Dani's survival depends on her joining forces with two warriors: 
      Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an enhanced super-soldier from the future, and a battle-hardened
       Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). As the Rev-9 ruthlessly destroys everything and everyone 
      in its path on the hunt for Dani, the three are led to a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) 
      from Sarah's past that may be their last best hope.
